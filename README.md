# basicJsIntro
Basic JS Intro developed for Mindera Software class.

This bundle of files was created for a very short (1hr) class for a very basic introduction
to JavaScript and how it interacts with webpages.  It is, essentially, just a basic addition 
calculator but with the option to show type casting to show students how JavaScript is powerful
but easily fooled.

The following files are in the repo:

# index.html
This is a very simple HTML file with an input field, a button to run the program, and a radio selector
to switch between Number type and string type.

# styles.css
This is a css file to style index.html.

# myCode.js
This is the javascript file to work with index.html
